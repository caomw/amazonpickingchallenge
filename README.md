#How to run uts recogniser?
Two kinds of sensors are involved in uts recogniser: a rgb camera(firewire camera in this case) 
and a rgbd sensor such as Kinect and Xtion. Start the two sensors before running this package.

You can test the code using `pseudo_request` which sends pseudo request to the `uts_recogniser`
